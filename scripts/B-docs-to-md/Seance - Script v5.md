\+ Explanation

_The Player is directed to interact with the talking board - it’s rattling - to summon the Ghost Choir?_

\+ Explanation

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** Did you get my good side?

\+ Interaction  
The player takes enough photos of Lin Shu-Mei to completely fill up the crystal. Upon filling the crystal, the camera screen turns red. Through the lens, a pitch-black figure appears behind Lin Shu-mei. The shadow’s hands rest on her shoulders like a puppeteer controlling a marionette. Its face is in shadow.

_

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

# △ Section: The demon's rules

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion (Serious)

**(Client)** This girl whose body I’m using: her family - the Lin family - they did me a great wrong. They took my heart. Cut it from me. As long as they have my heart, I can never know peace! But the whole family has died. My heart is lost. I need you to contact their spirits, and find my heart.  

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** Don’t trust / Power / Deceitful  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** As the Player considers the Ghostly Assistant’s words, Lin Shu-mei blinks and looks helpless.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion (Powerful)

**(Client)** There are two rules. First, never touch me. You will not like the consequences. Second, do not end a summoning unless I tell you to. Do you understand?

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** That look in your eyes... Interesting. You’re thinking that without my heart, I’m weak. Perhaps you think you should try to free this girl from my grip? Well, try to, if you like. But know this: if you stop being useful to me, I will eat your soul. And the soul of this girl, too.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-mei listens, making firm eye contact with the player. She grins, and claps her hands together, suddenly excited.

\+ Explanation  
While Lin Shu-Mei looks around, the desk vibrates from the energy of the talking board, making a rhythmic clatter-clatter-clatter sound. As the desk shakes, the flames on the candelabra grow larger until they suddenly burst. The room is plunged into darkness, and the candelabra is violently thrown by an invisible force, hitting the floor with a loud crash.

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** Open the seals / Unbind their mouths

\+ Explanation  
_Three photographs are visible on the walls, each marked with an energy seal. When the player looks at a photograph, it begins to move and speak and we hear the voice of one of the children, saying positive and kind things. After the Player uses the camera to collect and photograph them, this removes the seal, and the children’s words turn sour and mean…

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-mei screams again. Mid-scream, she slowly lowers the hands covering her face, revealing a cold, sinister smirk (The Demon has retaken control).

\+ Voiceover

**(Brother)** He has become something, neither human nor spirit. Esteemed Medium, I understand your purpose. Know that the Demon cannot hear us in this place, so listen. Ah-Hui holds the key to finding the Demon’s heart. We need him to be whole if Shu-Mei and you are to survive.

_The Player uses the brush (functioning as a vertical version of automatic writing) to finish Lin Hui’s painting: a hole is added to the demon's chest. The outline of a pendant is drawn around the Trading House Logo. As the player completes elements of the picture, Lin WenZong narrates the story with the following lines._

\+ Voiceover

**(Brother)** Three hundred years ago, a Medium of distinct power took the heart from the demon and sealed it inside a pendant. Passed from father to son, this pendant brought the luck of the demon to the family business.

\+ Voiceover

**(Brother)** But my father was reckless and greedy, and he gambled the pendant away. I won it back, and kept it safe.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** Ah-Hui plunged a knife into my chest. He did not mean to do it. His hand was driven by the demon, in its blind and foolish rage.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** It is a beautiful painting, my friend.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** Lin Hui nods.  

\+ VolCap

**(Adopted Son)** Thank you, brother. I loved her more than anything.  

\+ VolCap

**(Brother)** I know. But now it is Mei who is in danger. The same demon that took the lives of Father and Chun-Hua will soon take hers, too.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion (Hopeless)

**(Adopted Son)** We are mere spirits. What can we do?  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** For many years, our family kept the demon chained, for its luck. It was controlled by a pendant. I wore it myself, but it was shattered into pieces when I was killed…

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Adopted Son)** I did not mean to…

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** I know. It is no matter. But: the pendant contained the heart, and it is the heart that controls the demon.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** And where is the heart now?  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** Lin Wen-zong points at the painting.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** Stands aside to allow you to see the painting clearly.

\+ Explanation

_Pause for the player to finish fixing their camera, if they haven’t already_.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** Esteemed Medium. You must gather the pieces of the heart, to defeat the demon. For all of us.

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** Lines! / Marks!

\+ Interaction  
The “piece” of the heart is a few black paint strokes, visibly painted across Lin Chua-Hua’s face. The player must trace them, which will remove them from the painting. Note that when the player has all the strokes, they will combine together to form the Trading House Logo.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** All of us caught a piece...

\+ Explanation

Two more paintings appear: the funeral portrait of Shan-de, and a portrait of Lin Wen-zong, holding the family ledger and looking important, standing in front of the warehouse (this was painted after he inherited the firm)

\+ Interaction  
The player collects the pieces of the heart from these two paintings, and tries to assemble them together.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** One more piece is missing… Ah-Hui? Are you hiding it?

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** Ah-Hui turns to face the player, and the last stroke of the heart lies across his chest. He flies towards the player, and stops in front of them.

The player removes the piece of the heart from Ah-Hui, who screams as it is done.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** Ah-Hui screams as the heart is taken from him, as though we are pulling a knife from his chest.

\+ Interaction  
The player assembles the pieces of the heart into place, forming the Trading House Logo. When the logo is completed the seams disappear, and it starts emitting a brilliant light.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** The logo of the Trading House. Our ancestors sealed the heart into this symbol so we could use the demon’s power. Reach out, Medium. We entrust this power to you.

\+ Interaction  
The Player holds their hand over the symbol and its energy absorbs into the player’s palm, leaving a faint imprint of the logo.  

# △ Section: A final wish

\+ Explanation  
_After the heart is absorbed, the pattern in the Player's palm flashes brilliantly before fading away.  
_

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** Once you return to the real world, you will need to carve this symbol into your palm. Then imprint it in blood onto Shu-Mei’s skin. This will exorcise the demon and leave it powerless. But! The demon must be inside Shu-Mei when you touch her, understand?

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Adopted Son)** Surely if the demon sees the Medium performing a ritual, it will kill our sister immediately!  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** My brother is right. There is only one way. One of us must go with you and fight the demon. To give you time to perform the ritual.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Adopted Son)** Take me. I have nothing.
