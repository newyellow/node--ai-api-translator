\+ Location

**(Parlour)

\+ Explanation  
_This sequence starts after completing both Lin Shan-de’s and Lin Chun-hua’s quest lines.  
_

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-mei gets up from the desk, approaches the Player, and leans in close. She studies the Player’s expression for a moment before speaking.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** So the Lin family hid my heart in a pendant, but old man Shan-de lost it.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-mei’s expression shifts instantly into something menacing.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** And his hysteric eldest daughter didn’t know where it went.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Accompanied by a sickening crack, Lin Shu-mei’s neck twists at a grotesque angle.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion (Threatening)

**(Client)** Too bad. Time’s running out, Medium. Don’t forget, I’m heartless.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-mei suddenly looks as if her soul has been vacuumed out; her head slumps powerlessly. Shortly after, her body begins to twitch and convulse. When she next speaks: it is Lin Shu-mei herself.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion: (Terrified and as if choking)

**(Client)** I can’t breathe. Please. Why can’t I breathe?

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-mei snaps her head up, clutching her ears. She screams. After the screaming stops, she looks up at the Player. Her eyes are filled with a desperate, breaking plea.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** Don't touch me... You mustn’t touch me...  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-mei screams again. Mid-scream, she slowly lowers the hands covering her face, revealing a cold, sinister smirk (The Demon has retaken control).  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** I will snap this little girl like a stick if you don’t get me what I need. And believe me, _you_ will be next.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-mei waves a hand across the table, and a painted portrait appears, showing Lin Chun-hua as a bride. It is painted by Lin Hui. Lin Chun-hua's smile is gentle, showing the deep affection the artist poured into the work.
