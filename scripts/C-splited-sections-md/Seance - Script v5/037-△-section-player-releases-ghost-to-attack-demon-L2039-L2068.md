\+ Explanation

_If the player still does not release the ghost from the camera, the Demon attacks the player. This triggers the Bad Ending. If the player releases the ghost, it shoots out of the camera in a blinding flash and drags the Demon out of Lin Shu-Mei’s body. The demon (black energy) and the ghost (white energy) begin to grapple and fight._

\+ Interaction

The player must release the ghost they brought with them from the camera. If the player does not do this in time, then go to Section: Bad Ending.
