**(Client)** Get away from me!  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-mei struggles briefly, but her head soon slumps forward. Shortly after, when Lin Shu-mei lifts her head again, her expression and mannerisms have transformed into those of Lin Shan-de. "Lin Shu-mei" examines her own body in disbelief, then with delight.

**(Client, Father)** Ha! Now I can restore the Lin Trading Company to its former glory.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Then one arm rises, as if on a string. Lin Shu-mei turns to watch in disbelief as her hand turns upright, and snaps its fingers. As the snap rings out, Lin Shan-de’s ghost is violently ejected from Lin Shu-mei’s body. Lin Shu-mei looks at Lin Shan-de with a triumphant smirk.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** You filthy old man. You don’t deserve to live. Not even your spirit deserves to survive.

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** Banish him! / Send him back! / The bell!
