**(Ghost Choir)** Lin Shan-De! / Father / The trader  

\+ Explanation

The flames of the candelabra on the desk (not the barrier candles, but those used for questioning) flicker intermittently.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Seeing the signs of activity at last, Lin Shu-mei looks quite nervous.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** Did you summon him? Where is he?  

\+ Explanation  
While Lin Shu-Mei looks around, the desk vibrates from the energy of the talking board, making a rhythmic clatter-clatter-clatter sound. As the desk shakes, the flames on the candelabra grow larger until they suddenly burst. The room is plunged into darkness, and the candelabra is violently thrown by an invisible force, hitting the floor with a loud crash.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion: (With an unsurprised laugh)

**(Client)** … He is refusing to be summoned?  

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** Won’t come / Low ghost / Trapped  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-mei watches the Player’s movements.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** Then you must find another way. I have to know: where did he hide my heart?  

\+ Explanation

If the player picked the father first, the game will now explain to the player about entering the spirit realm.

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** Go to him / Go  

\+ Interaction  
The Player places their hand on the talking board. The surrounding energy converges onto the Ledger. The Player departs for Lin Shan-de’s Spirit Realm.
