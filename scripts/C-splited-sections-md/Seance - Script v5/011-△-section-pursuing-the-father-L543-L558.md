# △ Section: Pursuing the father

\+ Location

**(Spirit Realm)** The room is filled with crates bearing the Lin Family Trading House logo (or posters/flyers with the logo plastered on the walls). Points of lights flicker in the air - and Lin Shan-de’s ghost is darting among them.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Father)** Where is it?... Where could it be?  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Father)** One of the points of light glows brilliantly. Lin Shan-de immediately flies toward it and grabs it, but the light dissolves into mist in his hand.
