The outline of a pendant is drawn around the Trading House Logo. As the player completes elements of the picture, Lin WenZong narrates the story with the following lines._

\+ Voiceover

**(Brother)** Three hundred years ago, a Medium of distinct power took the heart from the demon and sealed it inside a pendant. Passed from father to son, this pendant brought the luck of the demon to the family business.
