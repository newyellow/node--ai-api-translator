# △ Section: Summoning the sister

\+ Location

**(Parlour)**

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** That woman always took care of everyone…She lived a boring life. Singing while she did her chores. Looking after her idiot father.  

\+ Explanation  
_Before the Player can even operate the camera to release the spirit, a dark shadow bursts from the screen. The furniture in the room vibrates and floats into mid-air. Lin Shu-mei is lifted as well, spinning on her chair.  
_

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** Wild / Lost / Calm her!  

\+ Interaction  
The Player follows a guiding white light, tracing a complete "Double Happiness" (囍) character in the air. As the final stroke is completed, the character erupts in a brilliant light. The light fades; the furniture and Lin Shu-mei return to their original positions.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Sister)** A dazed Lin Chun-Hua stands in the center of the room. She is confused, unhappy.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion (Confused)

**(Sister)** This must be a nightmare...  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Sister)** Lin Chun-hua gradually regains her senses. She looks around, then gazes down at her hands. After confirming there is no blood on them, she lets out a sigh of relief.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Sister)** Finally Lin Chun-hua notices Lin Shu-mei and is filled with surprise and joy.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Sister)** Mei? MeiMei, is that you? You are all grown up!  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Sister)** Lin Chun-hua reaches out to embrace Lin Shu-mei. Just as she is about to touch her, Lin Chun-hua’s movements suddenly freeze.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion: (Alerted)

**(Sister)** But I know you. You’re not my sister. Not really...  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion: (Unthreatening, Manipulative)

**(Client)** Just tell me where my heart is. That’s all I want.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion: (Confused at first, but suddenly understanding)

**(Sister)** Heart?  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Sister)** Lin Chun-hua looks confused at first, but then understands the situation.
