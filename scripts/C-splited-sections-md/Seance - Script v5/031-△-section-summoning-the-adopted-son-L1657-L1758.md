\+ Location

**(Parlour)  
**

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion: (Vicious)

**(Client)** You’d better not be empty-handed.

\+ Interaction

The player releases Lin-Hui from the camera and into the room.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** Lin Hui clutches his head in agony.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** Lin Hui again? I told you to bring Lin Wen-Zong! Is this some kind of trick?

\+ Explanation  
_The talking board on the desk vibrates. Energy surges from Lin Hui’s body and flows directly into the board.  
_

\+ Interaction  
The player draws on the board. The pendant, broken. When the image is finished, blood pours from the board.  

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** The knife / The heart / Broken!

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** That’s the pendant that was broken when I stabbed Wen-Zong. It contained my heart?  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-Mei is stunned, then snaps her head up to stare deathly at Lin Hui, who stares back.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Adopted Son)** You should… you should see your face. I wish I could paint it.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion: (Savage)

**(Client)** I will tear you apart for this.  

\+ Explanation  
_A demonic claw suddenly manifests above Lin Hui.  
_

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** Lin Hui roars in response. All his grief is breaking out, like a ripple of energy, that flips the table (where the oujiia board and candles were placed) and sends things scattered.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-Mei is alarmed by the strength of his anger.

\+ Explanation

The bell flies to the floor, but lands within the player’s reach.

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** Fury / Rage! / Monster!  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** Lin Hui roars. The dark aura surrounding him transforms into several shadowy hands that lunge at Lin Shu-Mei.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** The shadow hands seize Lin Shu-Mei by the throat, but she doesn't flinch. She mimics the original Lin Shu-mei’s voice and assumes the posture of a victim.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion (Mocking)

**(Client)** Dear Ah-Hui… You wouldn’t kill MeiMei? Chun-Hua… would never forgive you…  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** For a moment, the shadowy hands around her neck retract. Then Ah-Hui roars again, the hands return twice, as powerfully, grabbing Lin Shu-Mei by the throat.

\+ VolCap (Action)

(**Client)** Grapples at the claws around her throat. Lin Shu-Mei is struggling now. She’s actually afraid.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion (Panicky)

**(Client)** Medium! Send him back! Do it now!
