\+ Location

**(Spirit Realm)** The Painting Studio  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** Lin Hui stands before the completed portrait of the Eldest Sister. He is shaking with emotion. Faint motes of light begin to drift outward from his body.  
  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** Lin Wen-zong manifests in front of the player.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** Esteemed Medium. For what comes next, you will need this.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** He waves his hand, and a table with a crystal on appears in front of the player.

\+ Interaction

The player must then take apart the camera, remove the old crystal, and put the new one in. While they do this the following scene plays out in front of them.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** Lin Wen-Zong joins Lin Hui.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** It is a beautiful painting, my friend.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** Lin Hui nods.  

\+ VolCap

**(Adopted Son)** Thank you, brother. I loved her more than anything.  

\+ VolCap

**(Brother)** I know. But now it is Mei who is in danger. The same demon that took the lives of Father and Chun-Hua will soon take hers, too.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion (Hopeless)

**(Adopted Son)** We are mere spirits. What can we do?  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** For many years, our family kept the demon chained, for its luck. It was controlled by a pendant. I wore it myself, but it was shattered into pieces when I was killed…

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Adopted Son)** I did not mean to…

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** I know. It is no matter. But: the pendant contained the heart, and it is the heart that controls the demon.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** And where is the heart now?  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** Lin Wen-zong points at the painting.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** You were a better painter than you knew, Ah-Hui. You captured a piece of the heart, right there. See?

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** Stands aside to allow you to see the painting clearly.

\+ Explanation

_Pause for the player to finish fixing their camera, if they haven’t already_.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** Esteemed Medium. You must gather the pieces of the heart, to defeat the demon. For all of us.

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** Lines! / Marks!

\+ Interaction  
The “piece” of the heart is a few black paint strokes, visibly painted across Lin Chua-Hua’s face. The player must trace them, which will remove them from the painting. Note that when the player has all the strokes, they will combine together to form the Trading House Logo.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** All of us caught a piece...

\+ Explanation

Two more paintings appear: the funeral portrait of Shan-de, and a portrait of Lin Wen-zong, holding the family ledger and looking important, standing in front of the warehouse (this was painted after he inherited the firm)

\+ Interaction  
The player collects the pieces of the heart from these two paintings, and tries to assemble them together.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** One more piece is missing… Ah-Hui? Are you hiding it?

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** Ah-Hui turns to face the player, and the last stroke of the heart lies across his chest. He flies towards the player, and stops in front of them.

\+ Explanation

The player removes the piece of the heart from Ah-Hui, who screams as it is done.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Adopted Son)** Ah-Hui screams as the heart is taken from him, as though we are pulling a knife from his chest.

\+ Interaction  
The player assembles the pieces of the heart into place, forming the Trading House Logo. When the logo is completed the seams disappear, and it starts emitting a brilliant light.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** The logo of the Trading House. Our ancestors sealed the heart into this symbol so we could use the demon’s power. Reach out, Medium. We entrust this power to you.

\+ Interaction  
The Player holds their hand over the symbol and its energy absorbs into the player’s palm, leaving a faint imprint of the logo.
