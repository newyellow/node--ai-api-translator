# △ Section: Exorcising the adopted son

\+ Explanation  
Lin Shu-Mei is being strangled. The player must find and ring the silver bell before she dies. But the player must find the bell, which has fallen to the floor since the table was thrown.

\+ Voiceover

**(Ghost Choir)** The bell! / Quickly! / Find it!  

\+ Explanation  
If the player runs out of time: the Demon finally defeats Ah-Hui and then, in revenge, devours his soul. The Demon then comes for the player, and it’s Game Over.

\+ VolCap(Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-Mei tears the hands from her throat, then straightens up, her posture full of power and command. She claws at the shadowy hands, and swallows them whole. Ah-Hui is gone. Then she turns on the player.

\+ VolCap(Action)

**(Client)** You didn’t ring the bell. Hoped he’d beat me, did you? I’ll have your soul for that!

\+ Explanation:

_This then triggers the standard “player breaks the rules” Game Over ending._

\+ Interaction  
If the Player uses the silver bell to send Lin Hui’s ghost back:

\+ VolCap(Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-Mei settles back into her chair. Panting, grinning. The danger, it’s exhilarating to her.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** That was the right choice, Medium. But no more distractions! You know what I want! I won’t be denied!

\+ VolCap(Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-Mei leans forwards towards you. Grinning, undefeated.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Client)** My heart was destroyed by Ah-Hui’s knife. But that means it will now be in the Spirit Realm, waiting to be found.

+VolCap (Action)

**(Client)** Lin Shu-Mei holds out both of her hands to the player.

**(Client)** Take my hands. Don’t be scared. I’ll be your connection to the Spirit Realm this time.

\+ Interaction  
The player takes her hands and enters the Spirit Realm.
