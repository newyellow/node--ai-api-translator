\+ Location

**(Spirit Realm)** Double Happiness (囍) decals are visible all around. A single chair stands in the center of the room. A photograph of "Lin Chun-hua and Lin Hui" can be seen within the space. Lin Chun-hua’s singing can be heard, though she has not yet appeared.  

\+ Interaction  
There are energy seals on the "Double Happiness" decals. The player takes photos of them.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Sister)** Lin Chun-hua appears, seated on the chair. She is wearing a red bridal veil (inscribed with Taoist talismans) and sits quietly, holding her fan.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Sister)** I’ve been dreaming of this for so long! Ah-Hui will marry me. He will paint me, and I'll sing. And Father can’t stop us. I will be free of him.  

\+ Interaction  
The "Vanity Mirror World" gameplay mechanic is integrated here. When the puzzle is solved, the Player hears Lin Chun-hua’s voice:

**(Sister)** Ah-Hui! You’re here!  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Sister)** Lin Chun-hua senses the Player’s presence. She stands and approaches.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion (Disappointed)

**(Sister)** But you’re not Ah-Hui. Ah-Hui always smells of paint.  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Sister)** Lin Chun-hua lifts her veil and looks at the Player, but then the sound of firecrackers erupts from the direction of the door. Lin Chun-hua turns her head in delight.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion (Excited)

**(Sister)** Ah-Hui!

\+ Explanation  
_The surrounding Wedding Spirit Realm turns dark.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Father, Sister)** When the lights return, Lin Chun-hua and Lin Shan-de are in the center of the scene. Lin Shan-de’s back is to the Player.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

\+ Emotion: Uncertain

**(Sister)** Father! You came?

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Father, Sister)** Lin Shan-de and Lin Chun-hua embrace. We see a dark energy transfer from Lin Shan-de to Lin Chun-Hua. Then Lin Chun-Hua pulls a hairpin from her hair, and stabs it into Lin Shan-de’s neck. He falls. Lin Chun-hua stares at her father in shock.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Father)** Why…?  

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Sister, Father)** As Lin Shan-de hits the floor with a heavy thud, Lin Chun-Hua grabs her face and lets out a piercing scream. Then a moment later, the scream stops and she stands straight, as if she does not know what has happened at all.

\+ Explanation  
_Shortly after, the panicked cries of many guests echo from the doorway.

\+ Voiceover

**(Young Client - Lin Shu-mei)** Father? Father! You killed him!
