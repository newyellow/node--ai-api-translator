# △ Section: The father's death

\+ Location

**(Spirit Realm)** To the Player’s left is an altar. In the center sits Lin Shan-de’s funeral portrait (depicting a sorrowful, lonely expression). Aside from bouquets on either side, the area is piled with copper coins and gold/silver jewelry. Directly in front of the Player is a coffin; the lid is not fully closed, leaving a narrow gap.

When the player looks at a photograph, it begins to move and speak and we hear the voice of one of the children, saying positive and kind things. After the Player uses the camera to collect and photograph them, this removes the seal, and the children’s words turn sour and mean…
