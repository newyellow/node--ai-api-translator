\+ Interaction  
The Player uses the camera to capture \[Clue 1: The Knife\], \[Clue 2: The Brazier\], and \[Clue 3: The Pendant, Shattered\].  

\+ Explanation  
_As you photograph each clue, Lin Wen-Zong talks about it. The image on the camera changes to a photograph of the event Lin Wen-Zong is describing, and we hear sounds to match the story being told - screams, fire, broken glass._

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** Ah-Hui plunged a knife into my chest. He did not mean to do it. His hand was driven by the demon, in its blind and foolish rage.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** We fought. A brazier was knocked over in the struggle, starting the fire that consumed us both.

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** The pendant containing the demon’s heart; I wore it everyday. But the knife struck it, and it shattered.

\+ Explanation

_After the third clue, the scene transforms: now the trading house is on fire.

\+ VolCap (Action)

**(Brother)** Lin Wen-zong looks at the Player.  

\+ Explanation

_Lin Wen-zong stands in the fire as he speaks._

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** The demon could not take my body. It burned. So it took my sister Shu-Mei instead.  

\+ VolCap (Dialog)

**(Brother)** That was my great shame. That I could not protect her. Esteemed Medium, you must save her now, and I will help you do it.

\+ Explanation

_The flames snap out; the Trading House returns to its original state._
