\+ Explanation

_如果玩家仍未從相機中釋放幽靈，惡魔會攻擊玩家，觸發壞結局。如果玩家釋放幽靈，幽靈會從相機中以耀眼的閃光射出，並將惡魔從林淑美體內拖出。惡魔（黑色能量）與幽靈（白色能量）開始纏鬥戰鬥。_

_If the player still does not release the ghost from the camera, the Demon attacks the player. This triggers the Bad Ending. If the player releases the ghost, it shoots out of the camera in a blinding flash and drags the Demon out of Lin Shu-Mei’s body. The demon (black energy) and the ghost (white energy) begin to grapple and fight._
